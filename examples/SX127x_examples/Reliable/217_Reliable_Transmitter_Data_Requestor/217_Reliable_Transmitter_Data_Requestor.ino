/*******************************************************************************************************
  Program Operation - This is a demonstration of the transmission and acknowledgement of a 'Reliable'
  packet.

  A reliable packet has 4 bytes automatically appended to the end of the buffer\array that is the data
  payload. The first two bytes appended are a 16bit 'NetworkID'. The receiver needs to have the same
  NetworkID as configured for the transmitter since the receiver program uses the NetworkID to check that
  the received packet is from a known source.  The third and fourth bytes appended are a 16 bit CRC of
  the payload. The receiver will carry out its own CRC check on the received payload and can then verify
  this against the CRC appended in the packet. The receiver is thus able to check if the payload is valid.

  The transmitter sends a payload to the receiver which is a request for the receiver to return some data.
  The payload request is just 2 bytes, the request type and the station the request is directed to.

  For a packet to be accepted by the receiver, the networkID and payload CRC appended to the packet by the
  transmitter need to match those from the receiver which gives a high level of assurance that the packet
  is valid.

  If the received packet is valid then a data payload together with the networkID and payload CRC are
  returned in a packet as an acknowledgement that the transmitter listens for. If the transmitter does not
  receive the acknowledgement within the ACKtimeout period, the original packet is re-transmitted until a
  valid acknowledgement is received.

  With this example and the matching receiver program, 218_Reliable_Receiver_Data_Requestor, the
  generation of the acknowledge by the receiver is manual and also returns data to the transmitter. This
  allows the transmitter to send a request to the receiver for it to return data. Since the acknowledge
  returns the networkID and payload CRC used in the original transmitted request, when the transmitter
  receives the acknowledge it can be very confident the data is geniune.

  Serial monitor baud rate should be set at 115200.
